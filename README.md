## What are Google Dorks

 Google Dorks, also known as Google dorking or Google hacking is a hacking technique which is  used to find the best desired search results without wasting time in exploring google for required information.
Normally, google dorks is used by researchers or hackers to find critical information about a company, individual, a software or app, a research topic or anything else.
But a normal person can also use google dorks in many places and can save time and will definitely get better information.

## How Google Dorks works

As you all know, Google crawls almost all websites and indexes almost everything available on that website including some sensitive information.
That simply means google exposes too much information about websites including the technologies used, username, passwords, and some other general vulnerabilities.

By using some simple techniques which we call google dorks, we are just exploring that sensitive information.
Apart from this, by using google dorks, we can also help google to understand more about what search results we are expecting from google.

- cybersecurity experts uses google dorks to find critical information which gets exposed by mistake or exposed by someone knowingly about anything so that they can later on hide or delete that so that no one can use that for any wrong purpose.
- researchers, content writers, journalists ,etc uses google dorks to gather all the information available on google about a particular topic so that they can use that information for reaching their own goals.
- students mainly uses google dorks to find answers to their questions which are from their textbook or asked by someone or for finding leaked versions of a course or a book for free.
- companies and their employees uses google dorks to gather information about their competitors and for finding honest reviews of their products or services so that they can use that information further for improving their products and services and which in results helps their company grow faster.

## What can we find from Google Dorks

## How to use Google Dorks

Let's learn this by an example.
While searching for any free ebook , once add filetype:pdf in your google search box along with book name and in results google will only show you only those search results which have a pdf with the same name as you typed in the search box.
For a better understanding, once try this on your own.
